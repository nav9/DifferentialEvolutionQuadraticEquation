# Differential Evolution Quadratic Equation
This program uses Differential Evolution to find the solutions to quadratic equations. 
As of now, the check of whether the roots are equal, is being done outside the fitness function. The fitness function has to be modified to incorporate the checking for roots using the sqrt(b*b-4*a*c) formula.
